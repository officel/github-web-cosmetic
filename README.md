# github web cosmetic

## motivation

I refer to the Terraformers module (thank you for your great work).

It is a pity that the table is not visible, even though there is a lot of information in the table.

It should be easier to see when using a wide display.

## motivation 2

The width of the sidebar is too short and the experience is not good.

If you are using a wide display, it should appear a little longer.
