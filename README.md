# github web cosmetic

## motivation

I refer to the Terraformers module (thank you for your great work).
It is a pity that the table is not visible, even though there is a lot of information in the table.
It should be easier to see when using a wide display.

[how it looks](https://github.com/officel/github-web-cosmetic/issues/1)

## usage

- clone me to local pc
- open `chrome://extensions/` (Of course, with google chrome)
- switch on `developer mode`
- click `load unpacked` and select cloned folder
- that's all
